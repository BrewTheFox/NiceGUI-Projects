## NiceGUI Projects

This repository contains all the projects created and to be created using the NiceGUI library in Python. NiceGUI is a library that facilitates the creation of simple and attractive graphical interfaces.

### ImaGEN

ImaGEN is my first project developed with NiceGUI. It is an application that uses an API to fetch random images and display them in a graphical interface.

**Key Features:**

- Fetching random images: ImaGEN connects to an image API and downloads a random image each time the application is executed.
- Intuitive graphical interface: The user interface is simple and user-friendly, allowing users to interact with the application seamlessly.
- Included Image Caption AI Model
- Image display: Downloaded images are elegantly displayed in the graphical interface.

### Screenshots

_Insert some screenshots here to demonstrate how ImaGEN's interface looks in action._
